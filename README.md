# Stacks and queues visualization

This project is a Virtual Reality (VR) application developed using Unity 3D that provides a visualization of stacks and queues. It allows users to understand the fundamental concepts and operations of stacks and queues through interactive and engaging VR experiences.

### Features
* Stack Visualization: Users can understand how elements are added to and removed from a stack, following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The visualization highlights the current top of the stack and visually represents the pushing ,peeking and popping operations.

* Queue Visualization: Users can witness the behavior of a queue, which follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The visualization demonstrates the addition of elements at the rear and the removal of elements from the front of the queue.

* Interactive VR Environment: The VR environment provides an immersive experience where users can navigate and interact with the visualized stacks and queues. Users can move around, examine the data structures from different angles, and perform operations using intuitive VR interactions.

* Element Manipulation: Users can add new elements to the stack or queue and remove existing elements, allowing them to experiment and observe the behavior of these data structures in real-time. The visualization dynamically updates to reflect the changes made by the user.
